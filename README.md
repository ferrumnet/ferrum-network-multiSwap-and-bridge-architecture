## Product Overview and Background

Ferrum takes a problem-driven approach to product development. We have utilized this approach in developing and deploying our Staking products and Incubator. Learning from those experiences, when it came time to allocate resources to the development of a next generation multi-chain aggregator we adopted the same due diligence process to assess the viability and need for another interoperability protocol in the market. When assessing product development, we start with a series of “why” questions.

1. Why is a multi-chain aggregator needed?
2. Why aren’t other mult-chain aggregators filling the demand and or issues outlined?
3. Why would users care about another multi-chain aggregator?
4. Why should we be the ones to build this multi-chain aggregator?

Answers to these questions are typically formed through a review of the technical architecture along with product deployment strategies of existing bridge providers. Our review found that indeed there is an unfulfilled need for a secure cross-chain swapping platform in the market, one that conforms to the highest standards of security both through technical architecture and business process security. We’ve committed ourselves to building the infrastructure needed to support such an interoperabilty protocol.
