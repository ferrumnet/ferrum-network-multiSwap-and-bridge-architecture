# üîè Security

We secure our systems by ensuring all access follows the [principle of least privilege (PoLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle\_of\_least\_privilege) protocols. A good example of this is the segregation of accounts where the dev, QA, and UAT environments are set up vs staging and prod environments. Each account is only accessible by individuals who need to access them for their core job functionality and access to staging and prod accounts is further restricted to lead engineers. The management of user access is done in an entirely separate account, further restricting access control and adding another layer of protection against external phishing and related attacks.
