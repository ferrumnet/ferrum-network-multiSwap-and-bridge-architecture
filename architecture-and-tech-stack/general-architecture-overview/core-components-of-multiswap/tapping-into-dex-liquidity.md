# üè¶ Tapping Into DEX Liquidity

With MultiSwap protocols, we integrate our Bridge Pool through 1Inch or other aggregators where applicable. If no aggregators exist then we tap directly into the router to gather quotes and conduct cross-chain swaps.

In the absence of a DEX on a network, the standard two-way liquidity pool protocols come into play.
