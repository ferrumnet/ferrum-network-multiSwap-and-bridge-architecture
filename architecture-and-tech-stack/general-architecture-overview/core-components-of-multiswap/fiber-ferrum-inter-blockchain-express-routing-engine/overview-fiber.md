# üìê Overview - FIBER

### Introducing FIBER Engine

At a high level, FIBER is responsible for finding the optimal path to conduct swaps across chains, as well as bridging and settlement; depending on the asset type. If the asset has liquidity in the `bridgePool` these assets are classified as Foundry Assets. All foundry assets benefit from reduced fees during a swap across chains as one less swap needs to be conducted on the source or destination chain.&#x20;

A typical FIBER call includes the following parameters:

1. `sourceCABN`
2. `sourceFerrumNetworkIdentifier`
3. `destinationCABN`

5. `amountSourceCABN` or `amountDestinationCABN`
