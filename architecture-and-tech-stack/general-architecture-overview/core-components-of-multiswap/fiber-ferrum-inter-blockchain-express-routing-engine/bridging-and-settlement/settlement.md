# âš– Settlement

Settlement events take place when the [Refinery Asset](../../asset-types/refinery-assets.md) or [Ionic Asset](../../asset-types/ionic-assets.md) swap on the destination chain falls outside of the desired slippage tolerance parameters provided as part of the FIBER request.&#x20;

In this scenario, the asset is settled in a Foundry Asset, typically USDC.
