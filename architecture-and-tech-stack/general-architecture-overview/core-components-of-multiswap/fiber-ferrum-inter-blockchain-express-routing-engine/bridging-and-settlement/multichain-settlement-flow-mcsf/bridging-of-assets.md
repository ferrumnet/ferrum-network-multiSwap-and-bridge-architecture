# 🌁 Bridging of Assets

Once an asset is converted to a [Foundry Asset](../../../asset-types/foundry-assets.md) the bridging process is initiated. Foundry Assets are deposited into the `bridgePool` on the source chain. After the verification of the deposit is completed, a signed withdrawal item and a Release and Deposit Request (RDR) is initiated on the destination network.
