# üìê Overview - MCSF

MultiSwap enables any asset $$x$$ on network 1 to be swapped for any asset $$y$$ on network 2. To facilitate these multi-chain swaps, FIBER uses [MCSF](../../../../../../resources/glossary-and-acronyms/acronyms.md#mcsf).&#x20;

The flow of swap and bridging of assets across chains follows four steps known as MultiChain Settlement Flow (MCSF)
