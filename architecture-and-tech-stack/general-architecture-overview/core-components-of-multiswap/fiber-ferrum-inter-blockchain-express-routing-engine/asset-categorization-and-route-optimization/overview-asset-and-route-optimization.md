# üìê Overview

After reviewing the parameters of a FIBER request, the FIBER engine determines the categorization of the assets involved into one of the following categories.

1. [Foundry Assets](../../asset-types/foundry-assets.md)
2. [Refinery Assets](../../asset-types/refinery-assets.md)
3. [Ionic Assets](../../asset-types/ionic-assets.md)

The categorization of assets defines the available paths to swap and bridge assets across chains. Foundry Assets will typically skip interaction with an aggregator (1inch) or DEX (UniSwap). Instead, FIBER will prepare a path for Foundry assets to interact directly with the `bridgePool`. Saving liquidity provider fees for the part of the cross-chain swap that involves the Foundry asset.

In each case, FIBER not only determines the optimal path between `bridgePool` vs DEX swaps, but also queries multiple ecosystem aggregators, and DEXs to determine the best possible rate for the swap and bridging of assets across chains.

It is possible for the `sourceCABN` to be a different category than the `destinationCABN`. FIBER's flexibility allows different asset categories to be swapped across chains in the most efficient manner possible.
