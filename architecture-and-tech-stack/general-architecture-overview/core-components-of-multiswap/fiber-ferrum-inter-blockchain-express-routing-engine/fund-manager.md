# 🏦 Fund Manager

Fund Manager is the smart contract responsible for liquidity management, configuration of Foundry Assets and bridging settlement. Thanks to the [FIBER Router](fiber-router.md), the Fund Manager does not need to directly interact with any external wallet, or DEX router contract adding additional layers of security to the MultiSwap architecture.
