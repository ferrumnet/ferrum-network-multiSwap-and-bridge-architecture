# 🏦 Fund Manager

Fund Manager is the smart contract responsible for liquidity management, the configuration of Foundry Assets, and bridging settlement. Thanks to the [FIBER Router](fiber-router.md), the Fund Manager does not need to interact with any external wallet or DEX router contract directly, adding additional layers of security to the MultiSwap architecture.
